# dragonshark-helpers
A list of helper commands to be installed in the ~/.bashrc of the console. The idea is for the following elements to be installed into /home/pi as-is:

1. `.dragonshark-bashrc` file.
2. `.dragonshark/` directory.

Then, in the ~/.bashrc file, add the following entries:

```
source .dragonshark-bashrc
```
